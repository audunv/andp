"""

This module contains various utility functions for connecting to Postgres.

IMPORTANT:

  * NEVER INCLUDE ARGUMENTS IN SQL STATEMENT ITSELF. USE args INSTEAD,
    THUS PROTECTING US AGAINST SQL INJECTION ATTACKS.

  * ALWAYS USE THE PsE FUNCTION WHEN EXECUTING SQL STATEMENTS. IT
    ENSURES THAT EXCEPTIONS ARE APPROPRIATELY CAUGHT.
